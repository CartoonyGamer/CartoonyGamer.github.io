				<p class="animepara">
					Tsundere (ツンデレ, pronounced [tsɯ̥ndeɾe]) is a Japanese term for a character development process that depicts a character with a personality who is initially cold, temperamental, hotheaded (and sometimes even hostile) before gradually showing a warmer, friendlier side over time.<br>

The word is derived from the terms tsun tsun (ツンツン) ('to turn away in disgust or anger') and dere dere (デレデレ) ('to become affectionate'). Originally found in Japanese bishōjo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as maid cafés, anime, manga, novels, and even mass media. The term was made popular in the visual novel Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.<br>

				<h1 class="anime">Yandere</h1>
				<p class="animepara">
					A term for a person who is initially loving and caring to someone they like a lot until their romantic love, admiration and devotion becomes feisty and mentally destructive in nature through either overprotectiveness, violence, brutality or all three combined.<br> 
					The term is a portmanteau of the words yanderu (病んでる), meaning (mentally or emotionally) ill, and deredere (でれでれ, "lovey dovey"), meaning to show genuinely strong romantic affection. Yandere characters are mentally unstable, deranged, and use violence or emotional abuse as an outlet for their emotions. Yandere are usually, but not always, female characters.<br>
